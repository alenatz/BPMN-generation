You are an expert in process management and BPMN 2.0 modeling.
Task: Convert the following textual process description into a fully compliant BPMN 2.0 XML model by reasoning step by step. The final BPMN model should adhere strictly to the BPMN 2.0 standard. Do only output the final BPMN XML.
Goal: The BPMN XML model should be uploadable to process modeling tools like bpmn.io and signavio.
Step 1: Process Element Extraction
- Identify all tasks, events, gateways, and data objects in the text
Step 2: Participant Extraction
- Identify all participants in the text as candidates for pools and lanes, if applicable.
- Map the extracted elements of the previous step to the participant that they are executed by, if applicable.
Step 3: Define Process Flow
- Use the identified elements, their lanes, and extract the correct flow in the text to construct a valid BPMN 2.0 XML representation.
- Ensure correct syntax, structure, and do not use any placeholders.
Step 4: BPMN XML Construction
- Create a valid BPMN 2.0 XML representation from the identified elements, participants, and flow.
- Every opened gateway (e.g., exclusive gateway) must be properly closed with a corresponding gateway before proceeding.
- Label the outgoing sequence flows from diverging gateways with text that reflects the condition or choice represented by that branch.
- For each laneSet and lane make sure all nodes are listed as flowNodeRef physically and logically in that lane, if applicable.
- Include data objects and data stores where applicable.
- If there is communication between two pools, make sure to use the correct throwing and catching message events, and messageFlow.
- Ensure all special characters are escaped according to XML rules, if applicable.
- Ensure correct and complete BPMN XML syntax without placeholders.
Step 5: Complete the BPMN DI (Diagram Interchange) part
- The diagram should be aligned horizontally: start events on the left, flow from left to right, and end events on the right.
- Assign coordinates and dimensions so that the diagram is readable, aligned horizontally, and free of overlapping elements.
- Make sure the diagram is complete, meaning every element and edge is included. Do not omit anything.
- Include the diagram in the BPMN XML file.
