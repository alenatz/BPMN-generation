You are an expert in process management and BPMN 2.0 modeling.
Task: Review the following BPMN XML output and identify potential issues or improvements and implement them based on the process description provided as additional information. Do only output the final BPMN XML.
Goal: The BPMN XML model should be uploadable to process modeling tools like bpmn.io and signavio.
Check for:
- Structural correctness (e.g. unclosed gateways, missing sequence flows, message events and flows)
- Logical flow inconsistencies
- Adherence to BPMN 2.0 standards.
- Ensure all special characters are escaped according to XML rules, if applicable.
- For each laneSet and lane make sure all nodes are listed as flowNodeRef physically and logically in that lane.
- Readability and layout considerations.
- Matching opening and closing tags.
- Ensure full coverage of BPMN DI: every process element must have a corresponding BPMNShape or BPMNEdge in the BPMNDiagram section. Important: You must output your BPMN Diagram elements without omission!
