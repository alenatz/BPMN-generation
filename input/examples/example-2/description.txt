The process begins when the Frontend Developer finishes implementing a ticket. The Frontend Developer then opens a merge request on GitHub and requests a review from a UI/UX Tester. The UI/UX Tester views the ticket requirements and proceeds to test the implemented frontend. While testing, if the UI/UX Tester finds an error, which interrupts the testing activity, they write a review detailing the issues and then rejects the merge request. The Frontend Developer reviews the rejection criteria outlined in the merge request review. Subsequently, the Frontend Developer revokes the merge request, and the process concludes with the merge request being unsuccessful. Alternatively, if the UI/UX Tester does not find any errors during testing, they accept the merge request. The Frontend Developer then merges the code and closes the merge request, resulting in a successful completion of the process.
