At the start of the exam registration period, you search for the exam dates and times of the lectures you have taken during the semester. You check if any of the exam times overlap. If there are overlapping exams, you decide which ones to take and then calculate the total credits of these chosen exams. If the total credits are not enough, you look for additional exams that you can take. Afterward, or if there were no overlapping exams to begin with, you register for the exams. The process concludes when you have successfully registered for your exams.
